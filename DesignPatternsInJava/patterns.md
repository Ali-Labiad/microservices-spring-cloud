## Interface Patterns : 
### Adapter(Interface, Object), 
The intent of **ADAPTER** is to provide the interface that a client expects while using the services of a class with a different interface.

### Bridge (Driver),
The intent of the **BRIDGE** pattern is to decouple an abstraction from the implementation of its abstract operations, so that the abstraction and its implementation can vary independently.

### Composite,
The intent of the **COMPOSITE** pattern is to let clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Facade
The intent of the **FACADE** pattern is to provide an interface that makes a subsystem easy to use.

## Responsibility Patterns : 
### Singleton , 
The intent of the **SINGLETON** pattern is to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global point of access to it.

### Observer, 
The intent of the **OBSERVER** pattern is to define a one-to-many
dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified so that they can react to the change.

### Mediator, 
The intent of the **MEDIATOR** pattern is to define an object that
encapsulates how a set of objects interact; this promotes loose
coupling, keeping the objects from referring to one another
explicitly, and lets you vary their interaction independently.

### Proxy.
The intent of the **PROXY** pattern is to control access to an object by providing a surrogate, or placeholder, for it.

## Construction Patterns: 
### Builder, 
The intent of the **BUILDER** pattern is to move the construction logic for an object outside the class to be instantiated.

### Factory Mehtod, 
The intent of **FACTORY METHOD** is to let a class developer define the interface for creating an object while retaining control of which class to instantiate.

### Abstract Factory, 
The intent of **ABSTRACT FACTORY**, or **KIT**, is to allow the creation of families of related or dependent objects.

### Prototype
The intent of the **PROTOTYPE** pattern is to provide new objects by copying an example rather than by bringing forth new, uninitialized instances of a class.
